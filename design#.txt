Design Considerations:

Number / type of ADTs

Data Flow

Invalid Inputs



ADTs:

InputTools
    readInt(): read integer input
        input: cstring prompt requesting an integer from the user
        output: a legal integer
    readChar(): read character input
        input: cstring prompt requesting a character from the user
        output: a legal character
    readString(): read cstring input
        input: cstring prompt requesting a string from the user
        output: a legal cstring
    checkInput(): check integer input
        input: an integer
        output: either a legal integer or an error message requesting another input, 
            to be repeated three times before program exits with error message.
    checkInput(): check character input
        input: a character
        output: either a legal character or an error message requesting another input, 
            to be repeated three times before program exits with error message.
    checkString(): check cstring input
        input: a string of characters
        output: either a legal cstring or an error message requesting another input, 
            to be repeated three times before program exits with error message.
